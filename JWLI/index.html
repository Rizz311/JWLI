        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>The Japanese Women's Leadership Intiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three
           visionary women in Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and
           Cathrine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women leaders, referred to as the
           Fellows, from Japan to Boston to recieve four weeks of hands-on experience and
           leadership development. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an
           Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of
           social change a reality. After returing to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make
           a difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this
           program is for the fellows to share knowledge and expereince they acquired in
           Boston with other women and social sector leaders within Japan.</p>
        <p>The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based
           nonprofit organizations, is administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons
            College School of Management's Center for Gender in Organizations.</p>
        <p>In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S.-Japan Foundation,
           JWLI expanded its vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012
            and 2013 these public forums provided information about the nonprofit sector
             and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to inspire women to take
              leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens,
               advocating for their involvement in adressing the needs of Japanese society.</p>
